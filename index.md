Welcome to the **Neural Fields Reading Group**. We are an online community that meets weekly to discuss the latest developments in Neural Fields and their applications in the virtual and physical world. Here's a curated list of papers that we use as reference material: [Awesome-Implicit-NeRF-Robotics](https://github.com/zubair-irshad/Awesome-Implicit-NeRF-Robotics). Join us to stay current on this exciting field!

Feel free to view and contribute on [Github](https://github.com/Neural-Fields-Reading-Group/neural-fields-reading-group.github.io).

Additional information will be provided soon.
