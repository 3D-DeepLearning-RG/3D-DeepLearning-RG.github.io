Welcome to the **3D Deep Learning Reading Group**. We are an online community that meets every other week to discuss the latest developments in 3D Deep Learning and their applications in the virtual and physical world. We are particularly interested in **Neural Fields, Implicit Representations, 3D Reconstruction and Generation, 3D in Robotics**, among other topics. Please check these curated lists of papers that we use as reference material: [Awesome-Implicit-NeRF-Robotics](https://github.com/zubair-irshad/Awesome-Implicit-NeRF-Robotics) and [Awesome Implicit Neural Representations](https://github.com/vsitzmann/awesome-implicit-representations). We welcome all suggestions on the reading group and paper discussion. Join us to stay current on this exciting field!

## <font color='#8EA7E9'>#</font> Join us

Join our reading group! We're just getting started and we're excited to have you be a part of it. We have a dedicated group on Slack in the Neural Fields workspace ([join here, if the link is expired please let me know](https://join.slack.com/t/neuralfields/shared_invite/zt-1uwu3vrna-r0MsrVuOn~jCt4SIXuZUIg)), where we coordinate our meetings and discussions. The channel we use is the **#reading_group** channel. If you haven't added it already, please go to **Add channels** or **Browse channels** to find it. ALternatively, please fill out this **[Google Form](https://forms.gle/w3smZ5Xuhi2oRoH69)** to let us know you're interested in joining the reading group. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need more information. We look forward to hearing from you!
